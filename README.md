## Social Media SQL Practice Project

This project is a personal initiative where I recreated a small-scale social media platform to refresh and strengthen my core SQL skills. Using mock data for users, posts, likes, and comments, I explored a range of realistic queries that reflect common patterns that would be encountered in real-world analytics. 

It gave me the opportunity to revise concepts like filtering, aggregation, window functions, CTEs, and conditional logic.. I plan to extend this to test more advanced topics like performance tuning and integrate with data visualization tools in the future.
